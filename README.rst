Plover Korean
=================
Korean systems for `Plover <https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover>`_.

The dictionaries and documentation are still under development. The work will mainly be focused on a system based off of the CAS layout but work based on the Sorizava layout is a future goal.

How to Install

System Overview - CAS-based Layout
==================
Following this is a brief description of the system based on the CAS layout. It will cover the main areas for syllable representation for Korean on this layout as well as some useful concepts outside of the spelling itself.

Key Layout
----------
The key layout is divided into three sections which represent the three parts of a syllable block in Korean: the initial, the medial, and the final.

The left hand is for the initial consonant sounds, the thumbs are for the medial vowel sounds, and the right hand is for the the final consonant sounds.

Initial Consonant Sounds
------------------------
You cannot write the consonant characters by themselves like "ㅈ". Instead you will need to write it out like "지읒" if the need ever arises as there is no fingerspelling of consonants in this system due to them not typically being used by themselves in Korean.

The keys for plain consonants as part of the layout are self explanatory. To make the aspirated versions of them you just add an ㅎ:

ㅊ
    ㅎㅈ
ㅋ
    ㅎㄱ
ㅌ
    ㅎㄷ
ㅍ
    ㅎㅂ

To make the tense versions you just add an ㅇ:

ㅉ
    ㅈㅇ
ㄲ
    ㄱㅇ
ㄸ
    ㄷㅇ
ㅃ
    ㅇㅂ
ㅆ
    ㅇㅅ

Vowels Sounds
-------------
The vowels are relatively straightforward as they are just constructed the same way they are normally in Korean. The * key is used as a fallback when just combining base vowels is not possible for the sound (like the "y" variation of vowels).

In practice vowels may be left out of a brief or modified from this format. This is purely a base reference to work from.

오
    ㅗ
아
    ㅏ
우
    ㅜ
어
    -ㅓ
이
    -ㅣ
으
    ㅏㅓ
애
    ㅏㅣ
에
    -ㅓㅣ

|

요
    ㅗ*
야
    ㅏ*
유
    ㅜ*
여
    -ㅓ*
얘
    ㅏ*ㅓ
예
    ㅗㅓㅣ

|

의
    ㅏㅓㅣ
외
    ㅗㅣ
위
    ㅜㅣ
와
    ㅗㅏ
워
    ㅜㅓ
왜
    ㅗㅏㅣ
웨
    ㅜㅓㅣ

Final Consonant Sounds
----------------------
These work pretty much the same as the initial consonants except on the right hand where the keys are in different orders. Korean can have multiple final consonants unlike initial consonants which would suggest a heavier use of the right hand but once briefs for words longer than one syllable come into play that is no longer always the case.

Spacing
-------

Punctuation
-----------
TODO: periods, commas, etc. include the lack of standard return stroke

English Letters
---------------
You can fingerspell any letter in the English alphabet with this system.
