# Korean Core

The Computer Aided Steno-machine, or CAS, features one of the two modern stenography systems for Korean in use today and was originally created by [Korea Steno](http://www.koreasteno.com/).

This document is meant to serve as a reference for the theory behind the system for those wishing to learn it, specifically with regards to the CAS-based system in [Plover's](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) [Korean plugin](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean). Most sections are just in the format of brief notes taken when studying theory books myself.
