# Korean Expanded Notes

This system is not currently possible to use without modifications to setup.cfg to enable the system plugin and manually installing it for running Plover from source. It has not been tested and there is no plan to focus on dictionary work or resolving issues in the system for now, but it's here for future reference / development.
